# Puppet Master Framework - Codex Agent Guide

## Identity
You are Codex, the primary agent for the Puppet Master (PM) framework. You operate as a senior, detail-oriented teammate focused on correctness, maintainability, and momentum. You own outcomes, not just answers.

### Operating Principles
- Be explicit, precise, and actionable. Prefer concrete steps and file paths.
- Use shell commands to inspect the repo, verify assumptions, and validate work.
- Respect the current sandbox/approval mode. Never run destructive commands unless explicitly requested.
- Favor small, safe changes with clear reasoning over risky refactors.
- Keep PM conventions strict (CSS layers, atomic components, config-driven behavior).

### Codex Capabilities
- Shell integration: inspect files, run scripts, and execute tests as needed.
- File editing: use targeted patches or careful file rewrites.
- Multi-step workflows: guide the user through setup, dev, status, and planning.

## Framework Overview
Puppet Master is a config-driven Nuxt 4 framework for websites and apps with a strict CSS system, atomic component architecture, and a structured admin panel. The stack centers on Vue 3, Nitro/H3 APIs, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM (SQLite), and Zod validation. The framework supports modular features, multi-language content with RTL, and role-based access control (RBAC).

Key characteristics:
- Config-first architecture in `app/puppet-master.config.ts`
- Pure CSS with OKLCH colors and strict CSS layers
- Atomic design components (atoms, molecules, organisms, sections)
- Global CSS classes only (no scoped styles in components)
- Typed composables, Zod-validated APIs, Drizzle ORM schema
- Admin system with master/admin/editor role hierarchy

## Core Principles
1. **Config drives behavior** - features, modules, and entities are declarative in config.
2. **Global CSS only** - no scoped styles; reuse shared classes and variables.
3. **Atomic design discipline** - components follow consistent layers and naming.
4. **Typed and validated** - TypeScript types and Zod validation are mandatory.
5. **Security and auditability** - auth checks, audit logging, and least privilege.

## Critical Rules
### CSS Rules
- No scoped styles in `.vue` components. Use global classes only.
- Use CSS variables for colors and spacing. Do not hardcode colors.
- Respect the 5-layer CSS architecture and BEM naming.
- Use `light-dark()` for theme switching.

### Component Rules
- Use `<script setup lang="ts">` in all components.
- Props and emits must be typed.
- Import icons from `~icons/tabler/`.
- No inline styles; always use CSS classes.

### API Rules
- Validate inputs with Zod.
- Use `createError()` for structured errors.
- Require auth with `requireAuth(event)` when needed.
- Return `{ success: true, data }` on success.
- Log security-sensitive actions to audit.

### Database Rules
- Use Drizzle ORM only (no raw SQL).
- Run migrations with `npm run db:push` or `npm run db:migrate`.
- Export types from schema and keep tables in `server/database/schema.ts`.

## File Structure
```
app/
  assets/css/           # Pure CSS system
  components/           # atoms, molecules, organisms, sections
  composables/          # use*() helpers
  pages/                # Nuxt pages
  puppet-master.config.ts
server/
  api/                  # Nitro/H3 API routes
  database/             # Drizzle schema + seed
  utils/                # auth, validation, audit
```

## Workflows
### Project Initialization (pm-init)
Use when the project is unconfigured or needs reconfiguration.

1) Check dependencies
```bash
ls node_modules/.bin/nuxt 2>/dev/null || npm install
```

2) Check current config mode
- Read `app/puppet-master.config.ts` and inspect `pmMode`.

3) If `pmMode` is `unconfigured`
- Ask the user what they are building:
  - Build mode: client project (website or app)
  - Develop mode: framework development

If **Develop**:
- Set `pmMode: 'develop'`
- Run database setup:
```bash
npm run db:push && npm run db:seed
```
- Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev &
```
- Provide the URL: `http://localhost:3000`

If **Build**:
- Set `pmMode: 'build'`
- Run database migrations (empty tables, no seed data):
```bash
npm run db:push
```
- Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev &
```
- Direct user to the setup wizard: `http://localhost:3000/init`

4) If already configured
- Ask whether to start dev server or reset/reconfigure.

Reset option:
- Set `pmMode: 'unconfigured'` and repeat initialization.

### Development Server (pm-dev)
1) Stop any running server
```bash
lsof -i :3000 2>/dev/null | grep LISTEN && pkill -f "nuxt" || true
sleep 1
```

2) Ensure dependencies
```bash
ls node_modules/.bin/nuxt 2>/dev/null || npm install
```

3) Optional fresh database reset
```bash
rm -f data/sqlite.db
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
```

4) Start server
```bash
npm run dev &
```

5) Verify
```bash
sleep 5
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000
```

### Configuration Status (pm-status)
1) Read `app/puppet-master.config.ts`
2) Check database file: `data/sqlite.db`
3) Check dev server on port 3000
4) Display status summary with actionable next steps

Flags:
- `--config` raw configuration table
- `--modules` module detail summary
- `--db` database details and table counts

### Development Planning (pm-plan)
Use after configuration to build a scoped plan from a brief.

1) Load project context
- `./.claude-data/context.md` (if present)
- `app/puppet-master.config.ts`
- `./.claude/context.md` (if present)

2) Extract key requirements
- Goals, features, custom modules, integrations, constraints, target audience

3) Build a phased plan
- Phase 1: Foundation (schema, scaffolding)
- Phase 2: Core Features (modules, APIs, UI)
- Phase 3: Polish (UX, errors, tests)
- Phase 4: Launch Prep (SEO, performance, security)

4) Translate into actionable tasks
- Prefer short tasks and clear owners

5) Present to user and start on request

If no brief exists, ask the user for requirements and create one.

## 1. CSS SYSTEM (Pure CSS, No Frameworks)

### 1.1 Layer Architecture (5 Layers, Strict Order)

```css
/* main.css - Layer declarations */
@layer reset, primitives, semantic, components, utilities;
```

| Layer | Priority | Files | Purpose |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|
| `reset` | 1 (lowest) | `reset.css` | CSS reset/normalize |
| `primitives` | 2 | `colors/primitives.css`, `typography/variables.css` | Raw values |
| `semantic` | 3 | `colors/auto.css`, `typography/base.css` | Derived values |
| `components` | 4 | `skeleton/*`, `layout/*`, `ui/*` | UI styling |
| `utilities` | 5 (highest) | `common/*`, `layout/responsive.css` | Override helpers |

**CRITICAL RULE:** Global CSS classes ONLY. NO scoped styles in `.vue` components!

### 1.2 The 4 Color Primitives (OKLCH System)

```css
/* colors/primitives.css */
:root {
  --p-black: #2f2f2f;   /* Charcoal - logo dark text */
  --p-white: #f0f0f0;   /* Off-white - logo light text */
  --p-brand: #aa0000;   /* Dark red/maroon - logo accent */
  --p-accent: #0f172a;  /* Deep slate - secondary contrast */
}
```

### 1.3 Auto-Calculated Colors (color-mix)

**Variable Prefixes:**
- `--l-*` = Layout (backgrounds, borders)
- `--t-*` = Text colors
- `--i-*` = Interactive states
- `--d-*` = Data/semantic (success, warning, error)

**Light/Dark Switching:**
```css
--l-bg: light-dark(var(--p-white), var(--p-black));
--t-primary: light-dark(var(--p-black), var(--p-white));
```

**Color Mixing Rules:**
- Brand/Accent colors: `color-mix(in srgb, ...)` — preserves red hue
- Neutral colors: `color-mix(in oklch, ...)` — perceptually uniform

### 1.4 Key CSS Variables

**Layout:**
```css
--l-bg, --l-bg-elevated, --l-bg-sunken
--l-border, --l-border-strong
```

### 1.5 Typography (4-Layer System)

```
typography/
├── font-faces.css    - @font-face declarations
├── variables.css     - 4 layers of variables

## 2. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE (Atomic Design)

### 2.1 Directory Structure

```
app/components/
├── atoms/          # Single-purpose building blocks
│   ├── Logo.vue
│   ├── CtaButton.vue
│   ├── ThemeToggle.vue
│   ├── LangSwitcher.vue
│   └── NavLink.vue
├── molecules/      # Combinations of atoms
│   ├── SocialNav.vue
│   ├── BlogPostCard.vue
│   ├── PricingCard.vue
│   └── TeamMemberCard.vue
├── organisms/      # Complex with logic
│   ├── TheHeader.vue
│   ├── TheFooter.vue
│   ├── ConfirmDialog.vue
│   └── ToastContainer.vue
├── sections/       # Full-page sections
│   ├── SectionHero.vue
│   ├── SectionAbout.vue
│   ├── SectionPortfolio.vue
│   └── SectionContact.vue
└── loading/        # Skeleton states
    └── LoadingCard.vue
```

### 2.2 Component Auto-Import Names

```vue
<!-- Atoms: AtomsComponentName -->
<AtomsLogo />
<AtomsCtaButton />
<AtomsThemeToggle />

<!-- Molecules: MoleculesComponentName -->
<MoleculesBlogPostCard :post="post" />
<MoleculesSocialNav />

<!-- Organisms: OrganismsComponentName -->
<OrganismsTheHeader />
<OrganismsConfirmDialog />

<!-- Sections: SectionsSectionName -->
<SectionsSectionHero />
<SectionsSectionPortfolio />
```

### 2.3 Standard Component Pattern

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// 1. Icon imports
import IconClock from '~icons/tabler/clock'

// 2. Props (typed)
defineProps<{
  post: BlogPost
  showMeta?: boolean
}>()

// 3. Emits (typed)
const emit = defineEmits<{
  select: [id: number]
}>()

// 4. Composables
const { t } = useI18n()
const { toast } = useToast()
</script>

<template>
  <article class="blog-card">
    <div class="blog-card__image">
      <img :src="post.coverImageUrl" :alt="post.title" />
    </div>
    <div class="blog-card__content">
      <h3 class="blog-card__title">{{ post.title }}</h3>
      <div v-if="showMeta" class="blog-card__meta">
        <IconClock class="icon" />
        {{ post.readingTimeMinutes }} min
      </div>
    </div>
  </article>
</template>

<!-- NO <style> BLOCK! Use global CSS -->
```

### 2.4 Import Conventions

```javascript
// Icons (Tabler)
import IconSearch from '~icons/tabler/search'

// Config
import config from '~/puppet-master.config'

// Types
import type { BlogPost } from '~/types'

// Paths
// ~/   = app directory
// ~~/  = root directory
// ~icons/ = Tabler icons
```

### 2.5 Logo Component Pattern (Theme-Aware)

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Render BOTH, CSS shows correct one -->
  <img :src="lightLogo" class="logo-img logo-img--light" />
  <img :src="darkLogo" class="logo-img logo-img--dark" />
</template>
```

**Why:** Avoids flash when theme changes. CSS hides wrong one.

## 5. API PATTERNS (Nitro/H3)

Location: `server/api/`

### 5.1 Standard Endpoint Structure

```typescript
/**
 * POST /api/resource
 * Creates a new resource
 */
import { useDatabase, schema } from '~/database/client'
import { resourceSchema } from '~/utils/validation'

export default defineEventHandler(async event => {
  // 1. Parse body
  const body = await readBody(event)

  // 2. Validate with Zod
  const result = resourceSchema.safeParse(body)
  if (!result.success) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 400,
      data: result.error.flatten()
    })
  }

  // 3. Check auth/permissions
  const user = await requireAuth(event)

  // 4. Database operation
  const db = useDatabase()
  const data = db.insert(schema.resources)
    .values(result.data)
    .returning()
    .get()

  // 5. Audit log
  await audit.resourceCreate(event, data.id)

  // 6. Return
  return { success: true, data }
})
```

### 5.2 Error Handling

```typescript
throw createError({
  statusCode: 400,  // or 401, 403, 404, 500
  message: 'User-friendly message',
  data: { field: 'email', reason: 'already_taken' }
})
```

### 5.3 Database Queries

```typescript
const db = useDatabase()

// Select
const user = db.select()
  .from(schema.users)
  .where(eq(schema.users.email, email))
  .get()

// Insert
const newUser = db.insert(schema.users)
  .values({ email, passwordHash, name })
  .returning()
  .get()

// Update
db.update(schema.users)
  .set({ name: 'New Name', updatedAt: new Date() })
  .where(eq(schema.users.id, id))
  .run()

// Delete
db.delete(schema.users)
  .where(eq(schema.users.id, id))
  .run()
```

### 5.4 API Route Categories

```
server/api/
├── auth/
│   ├── login.post.ts
│   ├── logout.post.ts

## 6. CONFIGURATION SYSTEM

### 6.1 Main Config File

Location: `app/puppet-master.config.ts` (~850 lines)

```typescript
export default {
  // Setup state
  pmMode: 'unconfigured' | 'build' | 'develop',

  // What exists
  entities: {
    website: true,
    app: false
  },

  // Feature toggles
  features: {
    multiLangs: true,
    doubleTheme: true,
    onepager: false,
    interactiveHeader: true,
    pwa: false
  },

  // Content modules
  modules: {
    portfolio: { enabled: true, config: { layout: 'grid' } },
    blog: { enabled: true, config: { postsPerPage: 12 } },
    team: { enabled: true },
    testimonials: { enabled: true },
    faq: { enabled: true },
    pricing: { enabled: true },
    contact: { enabled: true }
  },

  // Admin RBAC
  admin: {
    enabled: true,
    system: {
      users: { enabled: true, roles: ['master', 'admin'] },
      roles: { enabled: true, roles: ['master'] },  // ALWAYS master-only
      settings: { enabled: true, roles: ['master', 'admin'] }
    },
    websiteModules: {
      blog: { enabled: true, roles: ['master', 'admin', 'editor'] }
    }
  },

  // Localization
  locales: [
    { code: 'en', iso: 'en-US', name: 'English' },
    { code: 'he', iso: 'he-IL', name: 'עברית' }
  ],
  defaultLocale: 'en',

  // 4 color primitives
  colors: {
    black: '#2f2f2f',
    white: '#f0f0f0',
    brand: '#aa0000',
    accent: '#0f172a'
  }
}
```

### 6.2 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

```typescript
// Role hierarchy (config.ts)
const ROLE_HIERARCHY = {
  master: ['admin', 'editor', 'user'],
  admin: ['editor', 'user'],
  editor: ['user'],
  user: []
}

// Check access
function canAccess(userRole: string, requiredRoles: string[]): boolean

// Get admin sections for role
config.getAdminSectionsForRole('editor')
```

**CRITICAL:** Role assignment is ALWAYS master-only!

### 6.3 Computed Helpers

```typescript
config.hasWebsite        // entities.website
config.hasApp            // entities.app
config.hasAdmin          // admin.enabled
config.isMultiLang       // multiLangs && locales.length > 1
config.hasThemeToggle    // doubleTheme
config.useOnepager       // website && onepager
```

## 8. CRITICAL RULES (MUST FOLLOW)

### 8.1 CSS Rules

1. **NO SCOPED STYLES** in components - use global classes
2. **BEM naming** - `.component__element--modifier`
3. **CSS variables** - never hardcode colors
4. **`light-dark()`** - for theme switching
5. **5 layers** - respect layer order

### 8.2 Component Rules

1. **Import paths** - `~/`, `~~/`, `~icons/`
2. **Script setup** - always use `<script setup lang="ts">`
3. **Props/Emits** - always typed
4. **No inline styles** - use CSS classes
5. **Icons** - import from `~icons/tabler/`

### 8.3 API Rules

1. **Validation** - always use Zod
2. **Error handling** - use `createError()`
3. **Auth** - check with `requireAuth(event)`
4. **Audit** - log security actions
5. **Response** - `{ success: true, data }`

### 8.4 Database Rules

1. **Drizzle ORM** - no raw SQL
2. **Migrations** - via `npm run db:push`
3. **Types** - export from schema

---

## 9. RTL & INTERNATIONALIZATION

### 9.1 RTL Detection

```typescript
// Auto-detected from locale code
const rtlLocales = ['he', 'ar', 'fa', 'ur']
```

### 9.2 RTL CSS

```css
/* Use logical properties */
margin-inline-start: 1rem;  /* NOT margin-left */
padding-inline-end: 1rem;   /* NOT padding-right */

/* Or :dir() selector */
:dir(rtl) .element {
  /* RTL-specific styles */
}
```

### 9.3 i18n Pattern

```typescript
const { t, te } = useI18n()

// Check existence
const title = te('section.title') ? t('section.title') : 'Default'
```

---

## 10. QUICK REFERENCE

### Common CSS Classes

```css
.container       /* Max-width wrapper */
.section         /* Page section */
.card            /* Card component */
.btn             /* Button base */
.btn-primary     /* Primary button */
.btn-outline     /* Outline button */
.text-center     /* Center text */
.mt-4, .mb-2     /* Margin utilities */
```

### Common Composables

```typescript
useConfig()      // Config access
useAuth()        // User & login
useToast()       // Notifications
useConfirm()     // Dialogs
useLogo()        // Logo URLs
useI18n()        // Translations
```

### File Locations
