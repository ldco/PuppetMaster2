# Session Context

## Meta
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-11T17:15:00+03:00
- **Project**: Puppet Master
- **Branch**: master

## Current Task
Session focused on understanding the PM command system and fixing missing slash commands.
Discovered that new PM team commands (pm-team, pm-team-all, regional commands) exist as .md files
but aren't being discovered by Claude Code because they were added mid-session.

## Active Role
- **ID**: none
- **Name**: none (general PM Architect)

## Todo List
- [x] Run /start command
- [x] Investigate missing PM team commands
- [x] Find where skills are registered
- [x] Identify root cause (commands added mid-session, not discovered)
- [ ] Test PM team commands after restart

## Working Files
- .claude/commands/pm-team.md
- .claude/commands/pm-team-all.md
- .claude/commands/pm-il.md, pm-ru.md, pm-us.md, pm-fr.md, pm-jp.md, pm-ch.md
- .claude/roles/pm/_knowledge.md
- .claude/roles/pm/_base.md
- .claude/config.json
- .claude/settings.local.json

## Last Actions
1. Ran /start - displayed session info
2. User noticed PM team commands missing from /start output
3. Read _knowledge.md - 754 lines of PM framework docs
4. Discovered 44 role files (42 experts + 2 base files)
5. Found 15 PM command files in .claude/commands/
6. Read pm-team.md - documented 42 expert team review system
7. Investigated skill registration - found 2 locations (global + project)
8. Identified issue: commands created today at 16:43 weren't discovered

## Notes
- **PM Team System**: 42 experts (7 specialties x 6 countries)
- **Specialties**: UX, Fullstack, Frontend, Backend, FastAPI, DevOps, Security
- **Countries**: IL, RU, US, FR, JP, CH
- **Commands need restart**: pm-team, pm-team-all, pm-il, pm-ru, pm-us, pm-fr, pm-jp, pm-ch
- **Working commands**: pm-init, pm-dev, pm-status, pm-contribute, pm-apply
- **--deep flag**: Available on team commands for extended /ultra analysis
- **Command discovery**: Claude Code reads .claude/commands/*.md at session start

## Blockers
- PM team commands not discoverable until Claude Code restart
- This is expected behavior - commands discovered at session start

## Next Steps
1. Restart Claude Code to pick up new commands
2. Run /commands to verify all 15 PM commands are available
3. Test /pm-team and /pm-team-all
4. Continue testing setup wizard (2 commits pending push)
